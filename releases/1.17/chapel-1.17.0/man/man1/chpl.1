.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBchpl\fP command invokes the Chapel compiler. \fBchpl\fP converts one
or more Chapel source files into an executable. It does this by
compiling Chapel code to C99 code and then invoking the target
platform\(aqs C compiler to create the executable. However, most users will
not need to be aware of the use of C as an intermediate format during
compilation.
.SH SOURCE FILES
.sp
Chapel recognizes four source file types: \fB\&.chpl\fP, .c, .h, and .o.
.sp
\fBfoo.chpl\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Chapel sources are compiled by the Chapel compiler into C intermediate
code, which is then passed to the target compiler to be compiled into
object code.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBfoo.c\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
C source files are passed directly to the target C compiler.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBfoo.h\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
C header files are included in the generated C code.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBfoo.o\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Object files are passed directly to the target linker.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fIModule Processing Options\fP
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]count\-tokens\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Prints the total number of static lexical tokens in the Chapel code
files named on the command line.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-main\-module <module>\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
For programs that supply multiple possible entry points (main()
functions or module initializers that can serve as an entry point), this
option can be used to specify which module should serve as the starting
point for program execution.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-M, \-\-module\-dir <\fP\fIdirectory\fP\fB>\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Add the specified \fIdirectory\fP to the module search path. The module
search path is used to satisfy module \(aquse\(aq statements. In the current
implementation, the compiler tries to locate unresolved modules by
searching for a filename whose name matches that of the module. For
example, if the user program contains \(aquse foo\(aq and the .\fBchpl\fP
files listed by the programmer on the compiler\(aqs command line do not
define a module named \(aqfoo\(aq, the compiler will search for files named
\(aqfoo.chpl\(aq in the module search path. The complete path that will be
searched can be displayed using the \fB\-\-print\-search\-dirs\fP flag and is
composed of (1) the directories containing the .\fBchpl\fP files that
were specified on the compiler command\-line (in left\-to\-right order),
(2) all directories specified by \fB\-M\fP flags (in left\-to\-right order),
(3) all directories specified by the $CHPL_MODULE_PATH environment
variable (colon\-separated directories), (4) the compiler\(aqs standard
module search path.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]print\-code\-size\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Prints out the size of the Chapel code files named on the command line
in great detail: For each code file, first the code is echoed back to
the screen, prefixing each line with the number of lexical tokens it
contains, or *C* if the line only contains comments, or *B* if the
line is blank. Next, the total number of tokens for the file is printed.
Then the number of lines is displayed, broken down into code lines,
comment\-only lines, and blank lines. Then the maximum and average number
of tokens per line is displayed. Finally, a histogram of the number of
tokens per line is shown. After this information is printed for each
file, a grand total of the number of tokens across all the files is
displayed.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-print\-module\-files\fP

.INDENT 3.5
Compile code for single/[multi\-] \fIlocale\fP execution, changing \fIon
blocks\fP to normal blocks, evaluating the \fIlocale\fP expression for side
effects, and optimizing away all remote references in the code. When
$CHPL_COMM is set to "none", \fB\-\-local\fP is the default; otherwise
\fB\-\-no\-local\fP is the default.

code with many temporaries.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]cache\-remote\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Enables the cache for remote data. This cache can improve communication
performance for some programs by adding aggregation, write behind, and
read ahead. This cache is not enabled by any other optimization
\fIoptions\fP such as \fB\-\-fast\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]copy\-propagation\fP
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]ieee\-float\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]loop\-invariant\-code\-motion\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Enable [disable] the optimization that moves loop invariant code from
loop runs into the loop\(aqs "pre\-header." By default invariant code is
moved. This is currently a rather conservative pass in the sense that it
may not identify all code that is truly invariant.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]ignore\-local\-classes\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Disable [enable] local classes

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]inline\-iterators\fP
.INDENT 0.0

are defined in terms of a single loop. By default this is enabled.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]vectorize\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Enable [disable] generating vectorization hints for the target compiler.
If enabled, hints will always be generated, but the effects on performance
(and in some cases correctness) will vary based on the target compiler.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]optimize\-on\-clauses\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Enable [disable] optimization of on clauses in which qualifying on

which can often be optimized away.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]remote\-value\-forwarding\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Enable [disable] remote value forwarding of read\-only values to remote
threads if reading them early does not violate program semantics.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]remote\-serialization\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Enable [disable] serialization for globals and remote constants.

(experimental)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIRun\-time Semantic Check Options\fP
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-checks\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Turns off all of the run\-time checks in this section of the man page.
Currently, it is typically necessary to use this flag (or \fB\-\-fast\fP,
which implies \fB\-\-no\-checks\fP) to achieve performance competitive with
hand\-coded C or Fortran.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]bounds\-checks\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Enable [disable] run\-time bounds checking, e.g. during slicing and array
indexing.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Enable [disable] run\-time checks to ensure that an actual array
argument\(aqs domain matches its formal array argument\(aqs domain in terms of
(a) describing the same index set and (b) having an equivalent domain
map (if the formal domain explicitly specifies a domain map).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]local\-checks\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Enable [disable] run\-time checking of the locality of references within

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIC Code Generation Options\fP
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]codegen\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Enable [disable] generating C code and the binary executable. Disabling
code generation is useful to reduce compilation time, for example, when
only Chapel compiler warnings/errors are of interest.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]cpp\-lines\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Causes the compiler to emit cpp #line directives into the generated code
in order to help map generated C code back to the Chapel source code
that it implements. The [no\-] version of this flag turns this feature
off.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-max\-c\-ident\-len\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Limits the length of identifiers in the generated code, except when set
to 0. The default is 0, except when $CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER indicates a
PGI compiler (pgi or cray\-prgenv\-pgi), in which case the default is
1020.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]munge\-user\-idents\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
By default, \fBchpl\fP munges all user identifiers in the generated C code
in order to minimize the chances of conflict with an identifier or
keyword in C (in the current implementation, this is done by appending
\(aq_chpl\(aq to the identifier). This flag provides the ability to disable
this munging. Note that whichever mode, the flag is in, \fBchpl\fP may
perform additional munging in order to implement Chapel semantics in C,
or for other reasons.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-savec <dir>\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Saves the compiler\-generated C code in the specified \fIdirectory\fP,
creating the \fIdirectory\fP if it does not already exist. This option may
overwrite existing files in the \fIdirectory\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIC Code Compilation Options\fP
.sp
\fB\-\-ccflags <flags>\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Add the specified flags to the C compiler command line when compiling
the generated code. Multiple \fB\-\-ccflags\fP \fIoptions\fP can be provided and
in that case the combination of the flags will be forwarded to the C
compiler.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-g, \-\-[no\-]debug\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Causes the generated C code to be compiled with debugging turned on. If
you are trying to debug a Chapel program, this flag is virtually
essential along with the \fB\-\-savec\fP flag. This flag also turns on the
\fB\-\-cpp\-lines\fP option unless compiling as a developer (for example, via
\fB\-\-devel\fP).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-dynamic\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Use dynamic linking when generating the final binary. If neither
\fB\-\-dynamic\fP or \fB\-\-static\fP are specified, use the backend compiler\(aqs
default.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-I, \-\-hdr\-search\-path <dir>\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Add dir to the back\-end C compiler\(aqs search path for header files.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-ldflags <flags>\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Add the specified flags to the C compiler link line when linking the
generated code. Multiple \fB\-\-ldflags\fP \fIoptions\fP can be provided and in
that case the combination of the flags will be forwarded to the C
compiler.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-l, \-\-lib\-linkage <library>\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specify a C library to link in on the C compiler command line.

.INDENT 3.5
Specify a C library search path on the C compiler command line.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-O, \-\-[no\-]optimize\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Causes the generated C code to be compiled with [without] optimizations
turned on. The specific set of flags used by this option is
platform\-dependent; use the \fB\-\-print\-commands\fP option to view the C
compiler command used. If you would like additional flags to be used
with the C compiler command, use the \fB\-\-ccflags\fP option.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]specialize\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Causes the generated C code to be compiled with flags that specialize
the executable to the architecture that is defined by
CHPL_TARGET_ARCH. The effects of this flag will vary based on choice
of back\-end compiler and the value of CHPL_TARGET_ARCH.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-o, \-\-output <filename>\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specify the name of the compiler\-generated executable. Defaults to
the filename of the main module (minus its \fI\&.chpl\fP extension), if
unspecified.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-static\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Use static linking when generating the final binary. If neither
\fB\-\-static\fP or \fB\-\-dynamic\fP are specified, use the backend compiler\(aqs
default.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fILLVM Code Generation Options\fP
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]llvm\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Use LLVM as the code generation target rather than C. See
$CHPL_HOME/doc/rst/technotes/llvm.rst for details.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]llvm\-wide\-opt\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Enable [disable] LLVM wide pointer communication optimizations. This
option requires \fB\-\-llvm\fP and packed wide pointers. Packed wide
pointers are enabled by setting CHPL_WIDE_POINTERS = node16. You must
also supply \fB\-\-fast\fP to enable wide pointer optimizations. This flag
allows existing LLVM optimizations to work with wide pointers \- for
example, they might be able to hoist a \(aqget\(aq out of a loop. See
$CHPL_HOME/doc/rst/technotes/llvm.rst for details.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-mllvm <option>\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Pass an option to the LLVM optimization and transformation passes.
This option can be specified multiple times.

\fICompilation Trace Options\fP
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]print\-commands\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Prints the system commands that the compiler executes in order to
compile the Chapel program.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]print\-passes\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Prints the compiler passes during compilation and the amount of wall
clock time required for the pass. After compilation is complete two
tables are produced that provide more detail of how time is spent in
each pass (compiling, verifying, and memory management) and the
percentage of the total time that is attributed to each pass. The first
table is sorted by pass and the second table is sorted by the time for
the pass in descending order.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-print\-passes\-file <filename>\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Saves the compiler passes and the amount of wall clock time required for
the pass to <filename>. An error is displayed if the file cannot be
opened but no recovery attempt is made.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIMiscellaneous Options\fP
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]devel\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Puts the compiler into [out of] developer mode, which takes off some of
the safety belts, changes default behaviors, and exposes additional
undocumented command\-line \fIoptions\fP\&. Use at your own risk and direct any
questions to the Chapel team.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-explain\-call <call>[:<module>][:<line>]\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Helps explain the function resolution process for the named function by
printing out the visible and candidate functions. Specifying a module
name and/or line number can focus the explanation to those calls within
a specific module or at a particular line number.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-explain\-instantiation <function|type>[:<module>][:<line>]\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Lists all of the instantiations of a function or type. The location of
one of possibly many points of instantiation is shown. Specifying a
module name and/or line number can focus the explanation to those calls
within a specific module or at a particular line number.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]explain\-verbose\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
In combination with explain\-call or explain\-instantiation, causes the
compiler to output more debug information related to disambiguation.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-instantiate\-max <max>\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
In order to avoid infinite loops when instantiating generic functions,
the compiler limits the number of times a single function can be
instantiated. This flag raises that maximum in the event that a legal
instantiation is being pruned too aggressively.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]print\-callgraph\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Print a textual call graph representing the program being compiled. The
output is in top\-down and depth first order. Recursive calls are marked
and cause the traversal to stop along the path containing the recursion.
Only a single call to each function is displayed from within any given
parent function.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]print\-callstack\-on\-error\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Accompany certain error and warning messages with the Chapel call stack
that the compiler was working on when it reached the error or warning
location. This is useful when the underlying cause of the issue is in
one of the callers.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]print\-unused\-functions\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Print the names and source locations of unused functions within the
user program.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-s, \-\-set <config param>[=<value>]\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Overrides the default value of a configuration parameter in the code.
For boolean configuration variables, the value can be omitted, causing
the default value to be toggled.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-[no\-]permit\-unhandled\-module\-errors\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Normally, the compiler ensures that all errors are handled for code
inside of a module declaration (unless the module overrides that
behavior). This flag overrides this default, so that the compiler
will compile code in a module that does not handle its errors. If any
error comes up during execution, it will cause the program to halt.
.UNINDENT

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.sp
Most compiler command\-line \fIoptions\fP have an environment variable that
can be used to specify a default value. Use the \fB\-\-help\-env\fP option to
list the environment variable equivalent for each option. Command\-line
\fIoptions\fP will always override environment variable settings in the
event of a conflict, except for ccflags and ldflags, which stack.
.sp
If the environment variable equivalent is set to empty, it is considered
unset. This does not apply to \fIoptions\fP expecting a string or a path.
.sp
For \fIoptions\fP that can be used with or without the leading \fB\-\-no\fP
(they are shown with "[no\-]" in the help text), the environment variable
equivalent, when set to a non\-empty string, has the following effect.
When the first character of the string is one of:
.nf

.fi
.sp
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Y y T t 1 \- same as passing the option without \-\-no,
.sp
N n F f 0 \- same as passing the option with \-\-no,
.sp
anything else \- generates an error.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For the other \fIoptions\fP that enable, disable or toggle some feature, any
non\-empty value of the environment variable equivalent has the same
effect as passing that option once.
