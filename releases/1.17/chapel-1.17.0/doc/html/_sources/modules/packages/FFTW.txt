Single-threaded FFT computations via key routines from FFTW (version 3)

This module defines Chapel wrappers for key single-threaded 64-bit
routines from FFTW (http://www.fftw.org), version 3.  For
multi-threaded routines, refer to the :mod:`FFTW_MT` module.  Over
time, the intention is to expand these modules to support additional
routines, prioritizing based on requests and feedback from users.


To use this module:

1. Ensure that FFTW (version 3) is installed on your system. The
   current version of the Chapel module only supports double precision ``real(64)``
   transforms. We do support using the FFTW compatible wrappers provided
   by the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) (see below for usage).

2. Add ``use FFTW;`` to your Chapel code.

3. Include the appropriate libraries in your compilation command.

   a. For a standard FFTW installation, this may be as simple as including
      ``-lfftw3`` when compiling. You may also need to use the ``-I`` and
      ``-L`` flags to specify the locations of the header and library files
      if these are in non-standard locations.

   b. *Intel MKL* : To use the MKL FFTW wrappers, compile with ``-sisFFTW_MKL`` to include
      the ``fftw3_mkl.h`` header in addition to the usual ``fftw3.h`` header
      file. You may also need to add ``-I${MKLROOT}/include/fftw`` to point the
      compiler to the location of these header files. Refer to the Intel MKL
      documentation for the appropriate libraries to include.


As in standard FFTW usage, the flow is to:

1. Create plan(s) using the :proc:`plan_dft* <plan_dft>` routines.

2. Execute the plan(s) one or more times using :proc:`execute`.

3. Destroy the plan(s) using :proc:`destroy_plan`.

4. Call :proc:`cleanup`.


Note that each of the Chapel :proc:`plan_dft* <plan_dft>` routines
support both `in-place` and `out-of-place` versions of the
transforms, where the former versions use a single array for both
input and output, and the latter use two distinct arrays.

In future versions of this module, we anticipate improving the
plan_dft*() interfaces to make better use of Chapel features and
move further away from C-isms (like the overloaded role of `flags`
and the use of C-based types).  Such features are expected to take
advantage of Chapel's support for default argument values and
keyword-based argument passing.  We are also thinking about changing
the interface for the in-place routines to use array slicing rather
than separate arguments for the array and domain.

.. function:: proc destroy_plan(plan: fftw_plan)

   
   Destroy an FFTW plan.
   
   :arg plan: The plan to destroy
   :type plan: `fftw_plan`
   

.. function:: proc cleanup()

   
   Clean up FFTW overall.
   

.. data:: const FFTW_FORWARD: c_int

   Request a forward transform (i.e., use a negative exponent in the transform). 

.. data:: const FFTW_BACKWARD: c_int

   Request a backward transform (i.e., use a positive exponent in the transform). 

.. data:: const FFTW_ESTIMATE: c_uint

   Specify that a simple heuristic should be used to pick a plan
   quickly.  This will prevent the input/output arrays from being
   overwritten during planning. 

.. data:: const FFTW_MEASURE: c_uint

   Specify that FFTW should try and find an optimized plan by
   computing several FFTs and measuring their execution time.
   This can consume some time.
   

.. data:: const FFTW_PATIENT: c_uint

   Specify that FFTW should expend a greater effort finding an
   optimized plan. 

.. data:: const FFTW_EXHAUSTIVE: c_uint

   Specify that FFTW should expend an even greater effort finding an
   optimized plan. 

.. data:: const FFTW_WISDOM_ONLY: c_uint

   This is a special planning mode that is useful for querying
   whether wisdom is available.  When using it, the plan is only
   created when wisdom is available for the given problem; otherwise
   a `null plan` is returned.  This can be combined with other flags
   to create a plan if the wisdom available was created in that mode
   (e.g., :const:`FFTW_WISDOM_ONLY` ``|`` :const:`FFTW_PATIENT`).  For more details on
   this flag and the previous four, refer to `Section 4.3.2
   <http://www.fftw.org/doc/Planner-Flags.html>`_ of the FFTW manual
   

.. data:: const FFTW_DESTROY_INPUT: c_uint

   Specify that an out-of-place transform is permitted to overwrite
   its input array with arbitrary data.  This permits more efficient
   algorithms to be used in some cases. 

.. data:: const FFTW_PRESERVE_INPUT: c_uint

   Specify that an out-of-place transform cannot change its input
   array. 

.. data:: const FFTW_UNALIGNED: c_uint

   Specify that the algorithm may not impose any unusual alignment
   requirements on the input/output arrays.  This flag should not be
   necessary for current Chapel use since the planner will
   automatically detect such cases.  For more details on this flag
   and the previous two, refer to `Section 4.3.2
   <http://www.fftw.org/doc/Planner-Flags.html>`_ of the FFTW manual.
