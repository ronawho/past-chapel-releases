SharedObject
============
**Usage**

.. code-block:: chapel

   use SharedObject;



:record:`Shared` (along with :record:`~OwnedObject.Owned`) manage the
deallocation of a class instance. :record:`Shared` is meant to be used when
many different references will exist to the object and these references need
to keep the object alive.

To use :record:`Shared`, allocate a class instance following this
pattern:

.. code-block:: chapel

  var mySharedObject = new Shared(new MyClass(...));

When mySharedObject and any copies of it go out of scope, the class
instance it refers to will be deleted.

Copy initializing or assigning from mySharedObject will make
other variables refer to the same class instance. The class instance
will be deleted after all of these references go out of scope.

.. code-block:: chapel

  var globalSharedObject:Shared(MyClass);

  proc makeGlobalSharedObject() {
    var mySharedObject = new Shared(new MyClass(...));
    globalSharedObject = mySharedObject;
    // now mySharedObject is deinitialized, but the MyClass
    // instance is not deleted until globalSharedObject is deinitialized.
  }

:record:`Shared` supports coercions to the class type as well as
coercions from a ``Shared(T)`` to ``Shared(U)`` where ``T`` is a
subclass of ``U``. See :record:`~OwnedObject.Owned` for examples
of these coercions.



.. record:: Shared

   
   
   The :record:`Shared` manages the deletion of a class instance in a way
   that supports multiple owners of the class instance.
   
   This is currently implemented with task-safe reference counting.
   
   


   .. method:: proc forwarding_expr2_p()

   .. method:: proc init(type t)

      
      Default-initialize a :record:`Shared`.
      

   .. method:: proc init(p)

      
      Initialize a :record:`Shared` with a class instance.
      This :record:`Shared` will take over the deletion of the class
      instance. It is an error to directly delete the class instance
      while it is managed by :record:`Shared`.
      
      :arg p: the class instance to manage. Must be of class type.
      

   .. method:: proc init(src: Shared(?))

      
      Copy-initializer. Creates a new :record:`Shared`
      that refers to the same class instance as `src`.
      These will share responsibility for managing the instance.
      

   .. method:: proc deinit()

      
      The deinitializer for :record:`Shared` will destroy the class
      instance once there are no longer any copies of this
      :record:`Shared` that refer to it.
      

   .. method:: proc ref retain(newPtr: p.type )

      
      Change the instance managed by this class to `newPtr`.
      If this record was the last :record:`Shared` managing a
      non-nil instance, that instance will be deleted.
      

   .. method:: proc ref clear()

      
      Empty this :record:`Shared` so that it stores `nil`.
      Deletes the managed object if this :record:`Shared` is the
      last :record:`Shared` managing that object.
      Does not return a value.
      
      Equivalent to ``Shared.retain(nil)``.
      

   .. method:: proc borrow()

      
      Return the object managed by this :record:`Shared` without
      impacting its lifetime at all. It is an error to use the
      value returned by this function after the :record:`Shared`
      goes out of scope.
      

.. function:: proc =(ref lhs: Shared, rhs: Shared)

   
   Assign one :record:`Shared` to another.
   Deletes the object managed by `lhs` if there are
   no other :record:`Shared` referring to it. On return,
   `lhs` will refer to the same object as `rhs`.
