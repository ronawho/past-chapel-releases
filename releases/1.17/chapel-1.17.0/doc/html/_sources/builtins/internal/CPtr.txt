   :synopsis: This module contains Chapel types that can serve as C pointer

CPtr
====
This module contains Chapel types that can serve as C pointer
types for the purposes of interoperability and methods to work
with them.

See also :ref:`readme-extern`.


.. data:: const c_nil: c_void_ptr

   A Chapel version of a C NULL pointer. 

.. class:: c_ptr

   
   
   Represents a local C pointer for the purpose of C integration. This class
   represents the equivalent to a C language pointer. Instances of this class
   support assignment to other instances or nil, == or != comparison with a
   ``c_void_ptr`` or with ``nil``, and casting to another ``c_ptr`` type or to
   the ``c_void_ptr`` type.
   
   As with a Chapel class, a ``c_ptr`` can be tested non-nil simply
   by including it in an if statement conditional, like so:
   
   .. code-block:: chapel
   
     var x: c_ptr = c_ptrTo(...);
     if x then do writeln("x is not nil");
     if !x then do writeln("x is nil");
   
   Additionally, a ``c_ptr`` can be output like so:
   
   .. code-block:: chapel
   
     var x: c_ptr = c_ptrTo(...);
     writeln(x); // outputs nil or e.g. 0xabc123000000
   
   


   .. attribute:: type eltType

      The type that this pointer points to 

   .. method:: proc this(i: integral) ref

      Retrieve the i'th element (zero based) from a pointer to an array.
      Does the equivalent of ptr[i] in C.
      

   .. method:: proc deref() ref

      Get element pointed to directly by this pointer. If the pointer
      refers to an array, this will return ptr[0].
      

   .. method:: proc writeThis(ch)

      Print this pointer 

.. function:: proc c_ptrTo(arr: [])

   
   
   Returns a :type:`c_ptr` to a Chapel rectangular array.  Note that the
   existence of this :type:`c_ptr` has no impact on the lifetime of the array.
   The returned pointer will be invalid if the original array is freed or even
   reallocated. Domain assignment could make this :type:`c_ptr` invalid. If
   the array's data is stored in more than one chunk the procedure will halt
   the program with an error message.
   
   :arg arr: the array for which we should retrieve a pointer
   :returns: a pointer to the array data
   

.. function:: proc c_ptrTo(ref x: ?t): c_ptr(t)

   Returns a :type:`c_ptr` to any Chapel object.
   Note that the existence of the :type:`c_ptr` has no impact of the lifetime
   of the object. In many cases the object will be stack allocated and
   could go out of scope even if this :type:`c_ptr` remains.
   
   :arg x: the by-reference argument to get a pointer to. The argument should
           not be an array or domain (there is a different overload for arrays).
           Records, class instances, integral, real, imag, and complex types are
           supported.
   :returns: a pointer to the argument passed by reference
   
   

.. function:: proc c_sizeof(type x): size_t

   
   Return the size in bytes of a type, as with the C ``sizeof`` built-in.
   
   .. warning::
   
     This method is intended for C interoperability. To enhance
     flexibility, it is possible to request the sizes of Chapel types.
     However, be aware:
   
        * Chapel types are not necessarily stored in contiguous memory
        * Behavior of ``c_sizeof`` with Chapel types may change
        * Behavior given a Chapel class type is not well-defined
   

.. function:: proc c_calloc(type eltType, size: integral): c_ptr(eltType)

   
   Allocate memory and initialize all bits to 0. Note that this simply zeros
   memory, it does not call Chapel initializers (it is meant for primitive
   types and C interoperability only.) This memory should eventually be freed
   with :proc:`c_free`.
   
   :arg eltType: the type of the elements to allocate
   :arg size: the number of elements to allocate space for
   :returns: a c_ptr(eltType) to allocated memory
   

.. function:: proc c_malloc(type eltType, size: integral): c_ptr(eltType)

   
   Allocate memory that is not initialized. This memory should eventually be
   freed with :proc:`c_free`.
   
   :arg eltType: the type of the elements to allocate
   :arg size: the number of elements to allocate space for
   :returns: a c_ptr(eltType) to allocated memory
   

.. function:: proc c_free(data: c_void_ptr)

   Free memory that was allocated with :proc:`c_calloc` or :proc:`c_malloc`.
   
   :arg data: the c_ptr to memory that was allocated. Note that both
              `c_ptr(t)` and `c_void_ptr` can be passed to this argument.
   

.. function:: proc isAnyCPtr(type t) param

   Returns true if t is a c_ptr type or c_void_ptr.
   

.. function:: proc c_memmove(dest, const src, n: integral)

   
   Copies n potentially overlapping bytes from memory area src to memory
   area dest.
   
   This is a simple wrapper over the C ``memmove()`` function.
   
   :arg dest: the destination memory area to copy to
   :arg src: the source memory area to copy from
   :arg n: the number of bytes from src to copy to dest
   

.. function:: proc c_memcpy(dest, const src, n: integral)

   
   Copies n non-overlapping bytes from memory area src to memory
   area dest. Use :proc:`c_memmove` if memory areas do overlap.
   
   This is a simple wrapper over the C memcpy() function.
   
   :arg dest: the destination memory area to copy to
   :arg src: the source memory area to copy from
   :arg n: the number of bytes from src to copy to dest
   

.. function:: proc c_memcmp(const s1, const s2, n: integral)

   
   Compares the first n bytes of memory areas s1 and s2
   
   This is a simple wrapper over the C ``memcmp()`` function.
   
   :returns: returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if
             the first n bytes of s1 are found, respectively, to be less than,
             to match, or be greater than the first n bytes of s2.
   

.. function:: proc c_memset(s, c: integral, n: integral)

   
   Fill bytes of memory with a particular byte value.
   
   This is a simple wrapper over the C ``memset()`` function.
   
   :arg s: the destination memory area to fill
   :arg c: the byte value to use
   :arg n: the number of bytes of b to fill
   
   :returns: s
