   :synopsis: Atomic variables are variables that support atomic operations. Chapel

Atomics
=======
Atomic variables are variables that support atomic operations. Chapel
currently supports atomic operations for bools, all supported sizes of
signed and unsigned integers, as well as all supported sizes of reals.

Most atomic methods accept an optional argument named ``order`` of type
``memory_order``. The ``order`` argument is used to specify the ordering
constraints of atomic operations. The supported values are:

  * memory_order_relaxed
  * memory_order_acquire
  * memory_order_release
  * memory_order_acq_rel
  * memory_order_seq_cst

.. type:: atomic (bool)

   
   The boolean atomic type.
   


   .. method:: proc read(order: memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst): bool

      
      :returns: The stored value.
      

   .. method:: proc write(value: bool, order: memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst)

      
      Stores `value` as the new value.
      

   .. method:: proc exchange(value: bool, order: memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst): bool

      
      Stores `value` as the new value and returns the original value.
      

   .. method:: proc compareExchange(expected: bool, desired: bool, order: memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst): bool

      Equivalent to :proc:`compareExchangeStrong` 

   .. method:: proc compareExchangeWeak(expected: bool, desired: bool, order: memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst): bool

      
      Similar to :proc:`compareExchangeStrong`, except that this function may
      return `false` even if the original value was equal to `expected`. This
      may happen if the value could not be updated atomically.
      

   .. method:: proc compareExchangeStrong(expected: bool, desired: bool, order: memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst): bool

      
      Stores `desired` as the new value, if and only if the original value is
      equal to `expected`. Returns `true` if `desired` was stored.
      

   .. method:: proc testAndSet(order: memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst)

      
      Stores `true` as the new value and returns the old value.
      

   .. method:: proc clear(order: memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst)

      
      Stores `false` as the new value.
      

   .. method:: proc waitFor(val: bool, order: memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst)

      
      :arg val: Value to compare against.
      
      Waits until the stored value is equal to `val`. The implementation may
      yield the running task while waiting.
      

   .. method:: proc peek()

      
      :returns: Stored value using memory_order_relaxed.
      

   .. method:: proc poke(value: bool)

      
      Stores `value` as the new value using memory_order_relaxed.
      

.. type:: atomic (T)

   .. method:: proc read(order: memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst): T

      
      :returns: The stored value.
      

   .. method:: proc write(value: T, order: memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst)

      
      Stores `value` as the new value.
      

   .. method:: proc exchange(value: T, order: memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst): T

      
      Stores `value` as the new value and returns the original value.
      

   .. method:: proc compareExchange(expected: T, desired: T, order: memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst): bool

      Equivalent to :proc:`compareExchangeStrong` 

   .. method:: proc compareExchangeWeak(expected: T, desired: T, order: memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst): bool

      
      Similar to :proc:`compareExchangeStrong`, except that this function may
      return `false` even if the original value was equal to `expected`. This
      may happen if the value could not be updated atomically.
      

   .. method:: proc compareExchangeStrong(expected: T, desired: T, order: memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst): bool

      
      Stores `desired` as the new value, if and only if the original value is
      equal to `expected`. Returns `true` if `desired` was stored.
      

   .. method:: proc fetchAdd(value: T, order: memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst): T

      
      :returns: The original value.
      
      Adds `value` to the original value and stores the result. Defined for
      integer and real atomic types.
      

   .. method:: proc add(value: T, order: memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst): void

      
      Adds `value` to the original value and stores the result. Defined for

      for integer and real atomic types.
      

   .. method:: proc sub(value: T, order: memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst): void

      
      Subtracts `value` from the original value and stores the result. Defined

      the result.
      
      Only defined for integer atomic types.
      

   .. method:: proc or(value: T, order: memory_order = memory_order_seq_cst): void
