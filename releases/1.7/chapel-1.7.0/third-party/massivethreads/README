MassiveThreads README for Chapel
================================

This copy of MassiveThreads is being released with Chapel for
convenience and uses a snapshot obtained from the MassiveThreads
team at:

   http://code.google.com/p/massivethreads/

Note that while massivethreads was packaged with its README describing
how to integrate it with Chapel version 1.5, since then, we have
integrated it more directly into the Chapel source tree such that
setting CHPL_TASKS to massivethreads and rebuilding should be all
that's required to make use of it.  See doc/README.tasks for details.

We have made the following local modifications to the official
sources:

* performed the recommended update to myth_config.h from the
  massivethreads README for Chapel users to save individuals
  the trouble.
